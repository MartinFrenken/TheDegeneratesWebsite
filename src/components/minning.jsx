            <p style={{color:"white", textAlign:"justify", fontSize:"17px", paddingLeft:"40px", paddingRight:"40px"}}>Crypto mining is one of the most profitable businesses right now. The only problem emerges when people try to get GPUs or ASIC miners for the endeavour. Even if you would find them, they would be vastly overpriced. We are solving this problem with reliable contacts and sources in China. Invest in the NFT and be like a shareholder, that will receive a dividend profit every month.
            <br></br>

                It's important to us, to give you more than you pay for. We plan to invest at least 75 % of the mint money into ASIC miners, where the rest will go on our endeavours into the Metaverse. Our portfolio of ASIC miners will conduct 83 % bitcoin, 17 % kadana. We will pay-out 72% of all coins mined between all NFT holders in Ethereum every month. This will be a straightforward process as we will already have your wallet addresses.
                <br></br>
                We expect a ROI of 1,5 years in a more pessimistic case, if bitcoin would rise to 60 000$ again, you would have your investment back in less than 8 to 9 months.  Mint your NFT and start getting reliable passive income now!
