The Degenerate is a project completely different to other projects seen before. Therefore, we have complete trust (very certain) that it will sell out in a matter of minutes. We are so confident that we are offering a 75% money-back guarantee on all main minted NFTs. This is if we don't sell out more than 20 % of the project. Due to the fact that this is the minimum we need for our plans to move forward with mining, metaverse, etc.

So, itâ€™s basically a risk-free investment. We will also be fully transparent about what the costs are. All the information will be posted in our discord TRUST channel.

Not only do you get a fine 2D NFT art, but you will be also able to mint an exclusive 3D skin of your DEGENERATE on our website. This will be an exclusive collection for just the 2D holders as it acts as an access key. We are also currently speaking with Decentraland regarding a partnership, so stay tuned!
